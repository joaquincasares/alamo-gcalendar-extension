# (Unofficial) Alamo Showtime to gCalendar

Displays a link to quickly add Alamo Drafthouse showtimes to Google Calendar

## Description

Adds an asterisk to each showtime on a screening page. The asterisk then links to Google Calendar to create a quick and easy reminder for an upcoming movie. 

Set reminders for screenings you are thinking of attending, have purchased tickets for, or are not yet on sale.

Also ensures that the end time is correctly set by taking into account Start Time + Run Time.
